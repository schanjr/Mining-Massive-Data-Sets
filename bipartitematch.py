'''This algorithm gives the only 1 set of perfect matchings within a run. To get comprehensive matching results, simply switch the 
dictionary orders that is displayed here. For Example, the keys for graph is currently a0, a1, a2, a3, a4. Switch the order 
a4,a1,a2,a3,a0
a1, a4, a2, a3, a0,
a1, a2, a3, a4, a0,
a1, a2, a3, a0, a4.

There are many ways to do this but this precomputation may be expensive. Currently exploring other ways. '''



def bipartiteMatch(graph):
    '''Find maximum cardinality matching of a bipartite graph (U,V,E).
    The input format is a dictionary mapping members of U to a list
    of their neighbors in V.  The output is a triple (M,A,B) where M is a
    dictionary mapping members of V to their matches in U, A is the part
    of the maximum independent set in U, and B is the part of the MIS in V.
    The same object may occur in both U and V, and is treated as two
    distinct vertices if this happens.'''
